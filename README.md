A brief video presentation that provides an overview of the Zorang Delivery Optimization Project. This video will offer visual insights into the project's goals, strategies, and potential impact.
&nbsp;
## Objectives
- Deliver 100 parcels using 10 delivery agents.
- Ensure efficient route planning and agent utilization.
- Facilitate agents' return to the store post-delivery.
&nbsp;
## Features
- **Backend Calculations (`First.py`):** Handles logistics calculations.
- **Frontend Visualization (`Final.py`):** Displays routes using Google Maps API.
&nbsp;
## Approach
- Initial solution using Round-Robin distribution.
- Exploring K-Means Clustering and Clark-Wright Savings Algorithm for optimization.
&nbsp;
## Assumptions
- Simultaneous order readiness.
- Uniform agent speed.
- Straight-line distance consideration between coordinates.
